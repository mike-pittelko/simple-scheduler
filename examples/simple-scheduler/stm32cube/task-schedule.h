/* Prototypes for tasks
 *
 * There may be at most one function called for each time slot. The function you
 * define can call as many other functions as you like, but be cognizant of the
 * amount of time consumed by each.  For example: calling a functions that takes
 * 32ms to execute every 32ms will not leave any time for the 2ms, 4ms, 8ms, 16ms
 * tasks to execute without causing time to "slip" and tasks *skipped* the next time
 * the scheduler runs to catch up with the time pattern.
 *
 * On a given slot, will call the maximum time, then each match in descending order,
 * For example, at 16ms: the 16ms slot, the 8ms slot, the 4ms slot, and 2ms slot will
 * be called in that order.
